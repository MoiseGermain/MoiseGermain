## Hi, I'm Moise 👋 — Welcome to My Cloud Engineering Portfolio

I'm a **Cloud Engineer** with hands-on experience designing and automating scalable, secure AWS infrastructure. My work focuses on **cloud-native architecture, infrastructure as code (IaC), networking, Kubernetes platforms, and security-first deployment strategies**.

This portfolio highlights production-grade projects built to reflect real-world cloud solutions, focusing on automation, resilience, performance, and security best practices.

---

### 🔧 Core Competencies
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform, CloudFormation, and Helm to provision repeatable, secure AWS infrastructure.
- **Cloud Networking** – VPC design, Transit Gateway, VPNs, DNS (Route 53), ALB/NLB, and security groups/firewalls.
- **Container Orchestration** – EKS with Helm, service mesh, and deployment pipelines for microservices.
- **Cloud Security & Compliance** – Secure ingress/egress controls, secrets management, and regulatory-aligned architectures.
- **Cloud Migrations & Availability** – Multi-AZ/region high availability, disaster recovery, and failover planning with AWS native services.
