## Hi, I'm Moise 👋 — Welcome to My Cloud Engineering Portfolio

I'm a **Cloud Engineer** with hands-on experience designing and automating scalable, secure AWS infrastructure. My work focuses on **cloud-native architecture, infrastructure as code (IaC), networking, Kubernetes platforms, and security-first deployment strategies**.

This portfolio features **real-world projects** that reflect production-grade solutions and best practices used in modern cloud environments—built with a focus on automation, resilience, and performance.

### 🔧 Core Competencies
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – Terraform and Helm to provision scalable and repeatable AWS infrastructure.
- **Cloud Networking** – VPC design, Transit Gateway, VPNs, DNS (Route 53), ALB/NLB, and security groups/firewalls.
- **Container Orchestration** – EKS with Helm, service mesh, and deployment pipelines for microservices.
- **Cloud Security & Compliance** – PCI-aware architectures, ingress/egress controls, and secrets management.
- **Cloud Migrations & Availability** – Designing multi-AZ/region DR strategies using AWS native services.
